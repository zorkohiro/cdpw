========================

* Updated OHIF to 3.9.1
* The default value for the "DataSource" configuration is now "dicom-web"

  more optimized.

  Note that the microscopy mode is not stable yet in OHIF!

  viewer from loading with Orthanc 1.12.2


Version 1.1 (2023-11-24)
========================

* Updated OHIF to 3.7.0

  suggestion by Bernhard M. Wiedemann (bwiedemann@suse.de)
