This is a change to the amdgpu driver to add some Barco adapter support.

You need to build separate kernel packages, per this URL:

https://canonical-kteam-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/public/how-to/build-kernel.html

and use them to upgrade the CODE_DARK image we build. This cannot be
easily automated at this time.

The amdgpu.c gets inserted or the patch applied into the tree just before
the build binary step.
