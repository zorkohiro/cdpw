Unlike ther regular orthanc package, we do not put a startup script here.
This is because the complexity of waiting for the CODE_DARK volume to be
mounted is difficult as it is, so keeping orthanc and the additional
orthanc sub-packages separate has real value.

We also don't put a pre-configured set of json configurations here either.
That's also the province of the code that moounts CODE_DARK.
