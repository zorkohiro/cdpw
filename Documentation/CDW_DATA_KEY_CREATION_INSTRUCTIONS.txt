DATA KEY CREATION, version 2

These are the initial instructions for creating the data storage
device for the CDW workstation. It is intended for the Apricorn
secure storage device, but can be, for prototype purposes, applied
to any USB storage device.

1. Requirements

A 2GB or better USB device- USB 3.1 or newer.
A PC running Windows - 10 or 11 is fine.

2. Format

Insert the device (unlock it if it's an Apricorn) into the PC.
Format it via the Explorer:

 + Select NTFS type
 + Add CODE_DARK as the filesystem/volume label.

3. Create subdirectories

After formatting, create the following empty directories at the top
level of the newly formatted volume:

  reports
  config
  database

Alternate instructions for linux- caution! No seatbelts! Command

1. Requirements

A 2GB or better USB device- USB 3.1 or newer.
A PC running any recent linux distro.

2. Format

 A. Get a Command line window- Konsole, e.g.
 B. Install USB key.
 C. Find the device path- dmesg or sudo dmesg and you can get the sdX number of the just attached drive, e.g. /dev/sdb
 D. Clean up USB key- if this isn't a fresh key and has left over stuff, you'll have to delete all partitions to clean
 things up. Warning: this might be that you've selected the wrong drive and are about to saw off the branch you are
 sitting on. Best to use a completely fresh one, but if you have to clean things up use, e.g. for '/dev/sdb' being
 the newly attached drive:

   sudo wipefs -a -f /dev/sdb

 Any chit-chat about being unable to update partition tables, pull and reinsert the key or pull, reboot and reinsert
 the key.

 Look in /proc/partitions to see whether there are any sub-partitions on the inserted drive- for a fresh key there
 shouldn't be but some wankmar USB manufacturers will put a DOS label and partition on the device.

 D. run:
	+ sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
	+ To the Command prompt enter: o
	+ To the Command prompt enter: n
	+ To the question about primary or extended enter: p
	+ To the question about which partition (1-4) enter: 1
	+ Hit return for first and last sector- this should cover most of the disk
	+ If there is any complaint about old signatures, say Y to removing old signatures
	+ To the Command prompt enter: w

	This should leave back at a shell prompt
 E. Run: sudo mkfs.ntfs -L CODE_DARK -f /dev/sdb1
 F. Run: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
 G. Run: mkdir /mnt/{logs,reports,config,database}
 H. Run: sudo umount /mnt

This should leave you with a fresh data storage key.
