Version 0.4

This a quick checklist to check a Code Dark release for sanity.
Expect this to change and expand relatively quickly.

1. Booting

Does it boot correctly when you have the USB key inserted?

If it boots the hard disk, you may have to retry and hit ESC to get
into the ROM and boot the key that way.

Note: We may need a "prep" checklist for making workstations ready for Code Dark.
This should include setting up the BIOS to boot the USB key first. However- I have
notices what seems to be the Z840 ws randomly reverting to boot the primary hard
disk drive on occassion.

Booting correctly means booting and being presented automatically with a
screen where you can fire up a browser or a Konsole terminal session.
No crashes.

2. Setting System Time

Since the system is planned for being air-gapped it will not be able to use NTP
or other time synchronization protocols to set system time. Setting system time
is important for official reporting purposes.

You should be able to navigate to system settings (little circle lower
right on botton command bar on screen) and go to the settings icon- in
the search bar on the upper left search for 'clock' and you should see
a Dat & Time for change date & time. You should be able to set time
here.

3. Basic Orthanc Server Access

Firing up the browser and pointing it toward  http://localhost:8042 should get you
the Orthanc main screeen with no privacy complaints etc.

4. Multiple extended monitors and monitor resolution

Attaching more than one monitor (preferably before booting) should yield
multiple separately accessible screens. The monitors should be displaying
at the expected pixex density.

You should be able to right click the mouse on the desktop to be able
configure the display about what the Wayland server thinks about monitor
placement (e.g. right to left) and monitor orientation (for monitors
that flip).

Please report any artifacts like the monitor(s) freezing when moving
windows around across edge boundarie, or any freezing of obviously
incoreect video artifacts.

5. Importing Studies

Given that you know the IP address of the Code Dark workstation,
you can take that plus the default Orthanc Dicom Port of 4242
and attempt to load studies into the Orthanc database.
