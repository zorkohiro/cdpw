0. Required Hardware and Environment

Get a  8GB USB flash drive to install the ubuntu install image on.

Get a 16GB USB Key to become the target of the install. You
can certainly user a larger USB Key for the target of the install-
but this just makes it more painful when copying the gold master
to multiple keys for distribution.

You will need to be connected to the internet to perform the following
steps- but note that some careful steps need to be followed so as to
not make randomly different base images due to the aggressive attempts
by the ubuntu installer to update the latest sets of images.

1. Copy Ubuntu 24.04.2 from the iso image, e.g.:

 https://nnenix.mm.fcix.net/ubuntu-releases/24.04.2/ubuntu-24.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso
 sha256sum: d7fe3d6a0419667d2f8eff12796996328daa2d4f90cd9f87aa9371b362f987bf

Create an install USB key from this with dd on a linux system or rufus on a Windows system.
Boot it on any reasonable x86_64 system.

Select "Do not connect to the internet"
Skip any 'update' installer questions.

Set the timezone you are in. If you booted
up with an active internet connection it
should have made a good guess already.

Select 'Saruman B Orthanc' as the name. Select 'orthanc' as the name of the system.
Select 'orthanc' as the user, 'orthanc' as the password.
Select the defaults and erase the whole disk and install it.
Keep selection to require user password to log in.

Reboot to installed USB key when the installation is done.

2. Make sure code_dark USB storage key is available

Attach CODE_DARK USB storage key (and unlock it if its an Apricon USB encrypted drive)
after it appears the system is almost up. See CDW_DATA_KEY_CREATION_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
as to how to create this device.

Reboot when done.

3. Install our user level packages

After we come up, do

 sudo apt update

This will refresh our package lists but not actually install anything.

Then install base othanc:

 sudo apt install -y orthanc

Then fetch the latest kp-report package via:

 cd /tmp
 wget https://feralsw.com/cdw/kp-report-latest.deb
 sudo apt install -y /tmp/kp-report-latest.deb

Ignore and dismiss all alert boxes that will then show up before things
finish. As you continue along delete any popups asking to install updates.

4. System Control panel changes

Go to system settings.

Go to Ubuntu Desktop and shrink the taskbar icons and place the taskbar
on the bottom of the screen. Disable Home Folder on desktop.
Unpin 'A' window and help icons from taskbar on botton.

Search for Date & Time and disable automatic date and time.

Search for Privacy & Security
 Set under Screen Lock:
	+ 10 minutes blank screen delay
	+ Automatic Screen Lock ON
	+ Automatic Screen Lock delay 1 minute
	+ Lock Screen notifications ON
	+ Lock Screen on Suspend ON

 Set under Diagnostics:
	+ Send error reports to Canonical to NEVER

Fire up a Kconsole and pin it to the task bar

Right click on Desktop and select under arranged 'Keep arranged'.

#
# Set background to plain gray
#
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri none
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background primary-color gray

#
# Disable automatic updates && upgrades
#
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades
sudo systemctl disable apt-daily.timer
sudo systemctl disable apt-daily-upgrade.timer
sudo apt remove --purge -y unattended-upgrades
sudo apt remove --purge -y update-notifier


5. Configure the installed firefox

Remove crap buttons from bookmark bar
Settings/General
 Unclick "Open links in new tabs instead of new windows"
Settings/Home
 Set both Homepage and new tabs as blank page
 Uncheck Shortcuts Recommended Stories 

Enter about:config in address bar
Say yes to continuing and taking the risk
In the search bar enter sessionstore.
For browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash- set to false.
For browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes- set to 0.

Enter http://localhost:8042 in chrome and bookmark it. You should
have connected with the running orthanc server.

6. Upgrade kernel

#
# Upgrade kernel with updated amdgpu driver.
#

Upgrade the kernel packages to get the amdgpu driver fixes for multiple monitors.
See build instructions under kernel.

The modules you are interested in capturing out of the entire build will be something like:

linux-modules-6.8.0-62-generic_6.8.0-62.1020_amd64.deb
linux-image-unsigned-6.8.0-62-generic_6.8.0-62.1020_amd64.deb

Fetch the updated kernel and drivers:

 mkdir -p /tmp/kupdate
 cd /tmp/kupdate
 wget https://feralsw.com/cdw/1010_upgrade.tar
 tar xf 1010_upgrade.tar
 sudo apt install -y /tmp/kupdate/*.deb

Get them onto the USB key you are building in /tmp and
do 'sudo install linux-*.deb' on them and reboot.

6. Install gdm-settings and set up new login screen with label

Get a Kconsole

sudo apt install gdm-settings libglib2.0-dev-bin

Look under the Apps panel for the GDM-SETTINGS icon and fire it up.

Under Login Screen add /usr/lib/kp-report/code_dark_label_*.gif as the image.
You'll have to use ls to see what the latest label is.

Under Appearance change type to image and add /usr/lib/kp-report/KaiserRedSmall.png as the image.
Hit the apply Button. You will likely have to enter the password for user orthanc.
