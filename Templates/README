Template File Name Architecture

1. General modality type

We now have settled on making template names that start
with the DICOM modality, lower case, followed by an underscore,
followed by the specific template name.

Each modality will have a 'Generic' version that is specific
for what we'd like to see in a modality's report.

2. Rest of filename

The non-generic versions will have a lower case underscore joined
(instead of spaces) contracted name of the report. This will
be somewhat freeform but attempt to be consistent.

3. Possible future changes to reduce the separate number of
template files.

Have predictable variant versions for right/left for studies
which have obvious right/left (e.g., wrist, mammogram), or
with contrast / without contrast CT variants.
